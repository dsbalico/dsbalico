### 👨🏻‍💻 About me
Hello! I am a computer science student at the Technological University of the Philippines, with a passion for full-stack web development and a keen interest in expanding my knowledge and skills in other areas of the field.

Currently, I am studying data science and machine learning, and I am excited to continue exploring the latest technologies and techniques in these areas. I am also interested about ethical hacking and plan to dive deeper into this field soon.

My goal is to create high-quality and user-friendly projects that not only solve problems but also bring value to the user. I am always open to learning new things, and I believe that open-source development is a great way to share knowledge and collaborate with other like-minded individuals.

You can find some of my projects on my GitHub profile, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Thank you for visiting!
